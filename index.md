## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Automation and Intelligent Sensing at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). Previously, I was a postdoctoral scientist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

My research focuses on transforming healthcare through artificial intelligence and causal inference, with a specific emphasis on developing novel AI methodologies to improve the diagnosis and treatment strategies for cardiovascular disease. I address key challenges such as integrating complex multimodal data and bridging the gap in individualized decision-making, with the goal of enabling AI-powered precision diagnosis and personalized care in real-world clinical settings.
